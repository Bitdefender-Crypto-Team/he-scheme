A Toy Implementation in Python of [FV12]

A basic homomorphic encryption scheme inspired from [FV12] https://eprint.iacr.org/2012/144.pdf.
The starting point of our Python implementation is this github gist: https://gist.github.com/youben11/f00bc95c5dde5e11218f14f7110ad289.
Disclaimer: Our toy implementation is not meant to be secure or optimized for efficiency.
We did it to better understand the inner workings of the [FV12] scheme, so you can use it as a learning tool.
